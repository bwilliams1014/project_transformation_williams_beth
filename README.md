## Resources

* [W3C Schools](www.w3schools.com)
I used W3Schools for help with several areas of CSS including HTML5 semantics, using the datetime element, etc. It is my go to website when I don't remember how to do something.
* [Commit Message Guidelines](https://gist.github.com/robertpainsi/b632364184e70900af4ab688decf6f53)
I used this gist for help making commit messages.
* [How to undo almost anything with Git](https://github.com/blog/2019-how-to-undo-almost-anything-with-git)
I found myself going back to this page often when I needed to undo a change I made. I still find it confusing, but this information helped.
* [git reference](https://git-scm.com/doc)
I used the reference materials several times to help with different git commands.

## Comments
The thing that gave me the most trouble was the background image for the banner. I think it could be better, but I'm not sure how to do that.

Also there were numerous things that I would have changed stylistically, just for personal preference; but I tried to remain true to the original design as this project was focused on making the site responsive, not beautiful.
